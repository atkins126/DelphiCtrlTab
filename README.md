# DelphiCtrlTab
Plugin for Delphi IDE. Allows open tab navigation based on activity instead of tab oder.

I am a heavy user of the Ctrl+Tab shortcut. I always found the way the Ctrl+Tab behaves in the Delphi IDE to be very inconvenient.
In all other IDE's I am familiar with, hitting Ctrl+Tab will take you back to the previously active tab, but in Delphi navigation order depends on the order in which the tabs are arranged in the editor.

Whenever Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab is pressed a dialog displaying all open files is displayed.
Files are listed in the order in which they have been activated.

To navigate between files simply keep the Ctrl key pressed down and hit the tab key. Holding the shift key down naviagtes in the opposite direction.

Refer to wiki on instructions how to install the plugin.
